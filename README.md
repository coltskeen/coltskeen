### Hiya! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Colt. I am a Full Stack Software Engineer that loves designing and building web applications using tools like Node.js, Express, jQuery, SQL [posgreSQL and SQLite] and Three.js. I am a soon to be Army Veteran pursing what I love most: building simple and elegant software solutions. Oh and did I mention that I love Tolkien's works? Check out my favorite application: The Tolkien Daily at https://tolkien-inspiration.herokuapp.com/. More features coming will include The Greatest Adventure Mini Game and A Walk Down Tolkien Lane.

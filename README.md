I am a Full Stack Software Engineer, and I love designing and building web applications using both front and backend development tools.  I am a soon to be Army Veteran pursing what I love most: building simple and elegant software solutions. Oh and did I mention that I love Tolkien's works? Check out my favorite application: The Tolkien Daily at https://tolkien-inspiration.herokuapp.com/. Forthcoming features will include: The Greatest Adventure Mini Game and A Walk Down Tolkien Lane.
